# nur_sample_android

When downloading the Android samples note that the project(s) need to be opened separately from the Android Studio; Android Studio's direct Git open won't work.

Re-building NurApiAndroid: 

1. Select Build -> Rebuild Project
2. Select Build -> Generate APK (generates actually NurApiAndroid.aar)
2. Run CopyNurApiAndroid.bat to copy the produced AAR to each project in this repo
